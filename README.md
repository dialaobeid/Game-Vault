# Player-Archive
Group Project
## Group Task
As a group our task was to create a scalable, user-focused MERN app that demonstrates our skills with React, GraphQL, mutations, and MongoDB. The goal was to make a responsive user-friendly site that saves user-data for their next return while also including a RAWG game database that supports the data the searches for.
## User Story
```
I want to be able to find Video Games with a game cover. I want to be able to add my game progress to my profile. I want to be able to save the game to my library and see my list of saved games.
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
Given that I am using a video game search platform
When I open the application
Then I am able to see the search box
Where I can enter a game title, keyword, genre, or ID and I select the search button
Then I am presented with a list of games based on my search criteria
When I select Sign up I will be able to provide my email, username, and password and create an account
Then the header will give access to my profile
When I add a game from the game search
Then it will appear in library on my profile
When I edit my game progress in library
Then the progress percentage will update on the bar
When I click on the Remove button
Then the game will be deleted from the library
After I can select Home to search for more games or logout
```
